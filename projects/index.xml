Authors  Ryuichi Yamamoto (LINE Corp.) Eunwoo Song (NAVER Corp.) Jae-Min Kim (NAVER Corp.)  Abstract This paper proposes an effective probability density distillation (PDD) algorithm for WaveNet-based parallel waveform generation (PWG) systems. Recently proposed teacher-student frameworks in the PWG system have successfully achieved a real-time generation of speech signals. However, the difficulties optimizing the PDD criteria without auxiliary losses result in quality degradation of synthesized speech.</description>
